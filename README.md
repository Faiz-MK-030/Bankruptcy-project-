# Bankruptcy-project-
# Overview
This project investigates the application of various machine learning models to predict bankruptcy, which is crucial for financial risk management. Using a dataset of financial attributes from numerous firms, models like Multivariate Discriminant Analysis (MDA), Logistic Regression (LR), GBM Classifier, and Na√Øve Bayes are employed to identify potential bankruptcies.
# Dataset
The dataset consists of 92,872 entries with 13 attributes, primarily skewed towards non-bankrupt instances. Attributes include financial metrics like EPS, Liquidity, and Profitability. The data has been cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring robust model training.
